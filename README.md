Currently a WIP!

This is just a little game prototype I built to test the idea of a game where you have to edit the game's scripts as you play.

This repo also implements its own GDScript parser which could potentially be helpful for anyone else looking to implement something like that, since the built-in parser can't be used outside of the editor.
